# Vortex Programming Language

Vortex is a new programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. 
Built using Python, Vortex offers a variety of features including brackets in expressions, 
variables, unary operations, boolean and comparison operators, if statements, and while loops.

## Introduction

Welcome to Vortex, a programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. This documentation will guide you through all the features and capabilities of Vortex.

How to Use This Programming Language :

1. git clone https://github.com/maihoonprince/Vortex-Programming-Language.git
2. cd vortex
3. Run Shell.py file.
4. Now write code in Terminal.

# Language Basics

Syntax and Semantics

Vortex programs are composed of statements and expressions. The syntax is designed to be clear and concise.

## Data Types

Integer: Whole numbers.

Float: Numbers with decimal points.

String: Text enclosed in quotes.

Boolean: True and False.

## Variables and Constants
Variables are declared using the make keyword. Constants are declared using the const keyword.

make x = 10

make y = 20

make z = x * y

## Operators and Expressions

Bracket Preference
Vortex respects standard mathematical precedence, and brackets can be used to explicitly define the order of operations.

make result = (5 + 3) * 2  // result is 16

make result = 5 + (3 * 2)  // result is 11


## Arithmetic Operators
+, -, *, /

make result = 5 + 3 * 2  // result is 11

## Relational Operators
=, ?=, <, >

make x = 50 

make a = 6

make b = 6

if a ?= b do make x = 10 

## Logical Operators
and, or, not

## Unary Operators
-, not

make neg = -x

## Control Structures

Conditional Statements

make x = 50 

make a = 6

make b = 6

if a ?= b do make x = 10 

## Loops

make x = 0

while x < 50 do make x = x + 1
